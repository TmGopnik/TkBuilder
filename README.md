# TkBuilder
A Prototype Tkinter GUI helper tool, used for mapping coordinates for widgets on screen.
It is used to remove the hassle of constantly stopped your program changing the coordinates and launching it again.
Instead move the element on screen after selecting window size, and optional background for your window
change size etc.
Once posisition simply hit "R" to receive the coordinates to easily posistion you widget in your program with only minor adjustments.

# Key Binds

Up and Down Arrows to adjust speed:

Left And Right Arrows to increase or decrease width

WASD For moving your element

J for viewing speed

R to display your coordinates

# Backgrounds

On the left hand side in the bar, input your file-path to the background

example : 
C:/TestFolder/testimage.png

[ONLY ACCEPTS PNG's FOR THE TIME BEING]

I have included a folder with a multitude of supported backgrounds in the "test_images" Directory, feel free to test them out!

# File Structure
files must be in the same directory together to properly work [test_images optional if you wish to refrence them]
example
# New Folder |
# -icons [Mandatory]
# -TkBuilder.exe [Mandatory]
# -test_images[Optional]

# This is just a prototype, full GUI Builder with the option to download your gui code coming in the future.
